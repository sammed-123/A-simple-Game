		<p> The <b>jungle</b> is the land covered with dense forest and tangled vrgetation ,usually in hot climates. Application of th term has varied greatly during the past recent centuries. Before the 1970s, Tropical rainforests were gaenerally referred to as jungles ,but this terminology has fallen out of usage.One of the most common meanings of jungle is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the tropics. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through.This definition draws a distinction between rainforest and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse. Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, rainforests in areas where rainforest has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging. The successional vegetation that springs up following such disturbance of rainforest is dense and tangled and is a ‘typical’ jungle. Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level.

Monsoon forests and mangroves are commonly referred to as jungles of this type. Having a more open canopy than rainforests, monsoon forests typically have dense understoreys with numerous lianas and shrubs making movement difficult,while the prop roots and low canopies of mangroves produce similar difficulties.</p>

		<h2> WILDLIFE </h2>

		<p>Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"> vegetation</a> and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles can not be straightforwardly defined.Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and gerbils. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.The global wildlife population decreased by 60% between 1970 and 2014 as a result of human activity, according to a 2018 World Wildlife Fund report and its Living Planet Index measure.Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.</p>
